# How was AI used in the project?
I used AI ChatGPT throughout my development journey â€” it guided me step-by-step in writing Python and Streamlit code, debugging errors, integrating OpenRouter's API, and handling virtual environments.

AI also helped me structure my README, fix Markdown formatting, manage .env files securely, and finally upload the entire project to GitHub successfully.

# Conclusion
Participating in HackaTime Summer of Making has been an incredible experience. It gave me the motivation to learn new tools like Streamlit, OpenRouter AI, and GitHub â€” and to actually build something meaningful from scratch.

With the help of AI and the support of the Hack Club community, I was able to bring my project to life and gain hands-on experience in building and deploying real-world applications.

Huge thanks to the HackaTime team for organizing this amazing initiative â€” it truly sparked my creativity and helped me grow as a developer. Looking forward to learning and building more! ðŸ’»âœ¨
